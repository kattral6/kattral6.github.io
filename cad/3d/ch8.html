<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 D Model Objects</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireframes</strong></p>
<p>A wireframes model is a skeletal description of a 3D object. There are no surface in a wireframe</p>
<p>model: it consists only of points, lines, and curves that describe the edges of the object. With</p>
<p>AutoCAD you can create wireframe models by positioning 2D objects anywhere in 3D space.</p>
<p>AutoCAD also provides some 3D wireframe objects, such as 3D polylines ( that can only have a</p>
<p>CONTINUOUS linetype) and splines. Because each object that makes up a wireframe model must be</p>
<p>independently draw and positioned, this type of modeling can be the most time-consuming.</p>

<p><strong>2. Surfaces</strong></p>
<p>Surface modeling is more sophisticated than wireframe modeling in that it defines not only the edges</p>
<p>of a 3D object, but also its surfaces. The AutoCAD surface modeler defines facted surface using a</p>
<p>polygonal mesh. Because the faces of the mesh are planar, the mesh can only approximate curved</p>
<p>surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>3. Solids</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solid modeling is the easiest type of 3D modeling to&nbsp; use. With the AutoCAD solid modeler, you can</p>
<p>make 3D objects by creating basic 3D shapes: boxes, cones, cylinders, spheres, wedges, and tori (do-</p>
<p>nuts). You can then combine these shapes to create more complex more complex solids by joining or subtracting</p>
<p>them or finding their intersecting (over-lapping) volume. You can also create solids by sweeping a</p>
<p>2D object along a path or revolving it about an axis.</p>
